CHAPTER -1 


Introduction
-------------

what is unix ? how/why it is popular ? hisotry ?

Most powerful ,Multiuser OS, invented at AT&T Bell labs in 1965

tartgeted large comunity.

started by Deni Riche , Kenthompson .

started with pdp7 later ported to pdp 11 (512 kB)

Kenthompson created lang -B ( highlevel ) rewrote entire unix code in B language for portabilty - but few limitations

later Dennis rich worte C Lang - entire unix in c language.

1970 and later it is commercialized.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Prequisites : 

minimum 80MB hdd , 4MB RAM , procesessor 80286

Terminals :

out of 80 MB , unix files ocupies 40 MB ,the rest is swap space.

per terminal 1 MB minimum is required . more no of terminal required more memory.


Salient features
----------------

1 . Multiuser capability 

   Resource sharing , data sharing , shares same computer with different terminal

2. Multi tasking
   
   simultaneously doing tasks by multi users and single user ( background jobs)
   dumb terminal, teminal emulation , Back groud jobs, fore ground jobs.

3. Comunication

   
4. security 

user-level : assigning passwords

file-level : permissions

encryption/decription  : Unreadable format ( key )

5. Portablity 

 ported almost any computer 



Unix system organization
-------------------------

1 Application 

tools applications

2 SHELL

intracting with kernal executes program with kernal

command line interpreter 

sh 

type of shells

a. Bounrn shell (bourn) - $ 
b. c shell ( bjoy) - command allias , hisoty - %
c. corn shell - (david corn) 

3 kernal

core part of unix 

stored in a file called unix .

handles intrupts

process management ,  memory management.


4 Hardware


-----------------------------


Unix commands

- all small letters - case sensitive 

- option should always use  " - "

- press delete key to cancell the entire command

- ctrl+d to exit from the terminal / kill process 

 cc to compile c 

- grep (gobally search a regular expression and print it)

- dd to convert lower to upper case 




The Unix file system 

--------------------------------------------------------------------


Admin responsibilties

- login , intial password

- default shell, group

- creation of groups 



- It treats evrithing is as a file 

 even directory also treated also a file

- file system upside down tree

- file system begins as root and its denoted as / 
  
  / it self will have on file unix along with the bin,lib,dev,usr,tmp and etc directories
  
 - bin contains executable, all unix commands

 - lib contains library fuctions 

 - dev - device related files like ,disk drive , printer 

 - usr - contains user related files like home 
 - usr/bin also will have bin files

 - tmp - temp files created by unix / users , the files will be remove once the server / machine rebooted


Sailent features of unxi file system 
-------------------------------------

     - It has hierachical infrastructure
     - files can grow dynamically
     - files has access permissions
     - all devices are implemented as files
     

creating files
--------------

touch     <file_name>       - to create empty files

cat > <filename> - write into file

ctrl+d           - end of file and saves the file

copy files : 
------------

cp 

Delete :
--------
rm


rename :
---------

mv

list :
------

ls r?

ls -l ( lists no of disk blocks , by default one block ocupies 1024/512  )

m- shared memory files
c -char special files /dev
coulums  

1 .owner - group - others 
2. links
3 name of owner 
4 name of group
5 file creation / modified time 

links
---------

soft link

- if a file is very imp , you can establish more that one link same file
  the file safe if one link is removed
  avoids duplication of same content

- 




file permissions
-----------------

chomd options

+ - =

mask 
----------

umask - the default permissions depends on umask value

dir sticky bit - can not remove dir even if you give the write permissions

file sticky bit - it will stick around memorey . for fast access .


with out using umask 

mkdir -m 


bc ( basic clculator)
---------------------


expr 
------------




logname , uname , tty 
---------------------






Unix File system
-----------------


file system : files together with information about files

a hard disk can split into different file systems , file system 

cmchk - to know the block size of the file system 

minimum file size - 1 block ( by default 512/1024  bytes)

disk access are time consuming ( have to read many blocks)


bolcks can be divided into 4 parts 
-----------------------------------

1. boot blcok

   while booting the bootstrap loader will execute 

2. super blcok

   state of the file system ( how many files it can be accomadate)

3. inode table ( ls -i)

   information about the file . each
   
   owner of the file 
   group which the owner is belonging
   file type
   access permission of the file
   size of the file 
   date and time of modification
   date and time of access
   no of links to the file  
   addresses of the blocks where it is physically present

4. data block

   Thes contains the actual file content


sync is the command that sync the data of inode table and super blcok from RAM to had disk 


Storage 
---------- 



disk related commands
---------------------
df , du 

ulimit ( can restrict the file zie)
